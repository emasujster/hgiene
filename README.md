Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary

Maintaining mental and physical health through proactive behaviour and treatment. This includes talks with doctors and specialists, creating a community, as well as practising healthy habits and rituals. Individuals should realise their abilities, weaknesses and strengths, to cope normal with stresses of life, to work productively, as well as make contributions to their community.


## Background

Many people struggle with mental health issues, which could be caused by various factors. Sometimes the struggle comes with themselves and sometimes from the society or community around them. Whatever the cause may be, everyone deserves help with their treatment. This was always a worldwide problem, however, it is often a taboo topic. Recent generations are trying to break that cycle and through social media and other ways, they are trying to share awareness and the importance of mental well-being. 

The idea for this project came from both a personal and shared struggle. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, many households and individuals are suffering due to mental health issues. Now it has been escalating at a faster rate than before and many cannot provide help for themselves. 


## How is it used?

+ All individuals who seek for additional help with their mental and/or physical health should have access to this project
+ Certified specialist and doctors worldwide can give tips and leave their contact information
+ One should not use this project as an only treatment, it should be used for additional support and help for everyone who wants to join the community
+ Anonymous option should be provided in case the individual does not feel comfortable with asking questions publicly


## Data sources and AI methods

Users should be able to choose in what categories they wish to improve in terms of their mental and/or physical health. Thus, different resources should be used. Users interests, what they read and search for in the app should create a safe community and contact for them.


## Challenges

+ Users should understand that although this might provide professional help that this does not misplace real-life theraphy nor is equivalent to it
+ All the content posted must be minitored, safe and family friendly
+ Hateful comments and spam would not be tolerated


## What next?

One day it could be possible that users could communicate with their doctors over the app and their medical records could be safely transferred. It could become an app for users official health maintenance.
